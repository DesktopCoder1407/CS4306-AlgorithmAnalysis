/* -----Algorithm Design Block-----
* 
* Problem 1: There are n stacks of n identical-looking coins.
* All of the coins in one of these stacks are counterfeit, while all the coins in the other
* stacks are genuine. Every genuine coin weighs 10 grams; every fake weighs 11 grams.
* You have an analytical scale that can determine the exact weight of any number of coins.
* Design an algorithm to identify the stack with the fake coins.
* 
* Pseudocode:
* 
* 
* Performance Analysis:
