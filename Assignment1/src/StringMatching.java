/* -----Algorithm Design Block-----
 * 
 * Problem 3: Design an algorithm to determine whether two strings are the same.
 * 
 * First, the algorithm would check to see whether the lengths of the two strings
 * are the same. If not, the two strings cannot be the same. If so, a loop could
 * iterate through each character of the first string and compare it to the same
 * character index in the second string. If all the characters are the same, the
 * strings are equal.
 * 
 * Pseudocode:
 *
